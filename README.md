# data-driven-life
An implementation of Conway's game of life with a focus on analysis of world states

## Objective

DDL aims to be an implementation of GOL which pulls out and displays interesting information about the state of the world.

## Modules

DDL is divided into three parts.

1. The core of DDL is a Node.js server presenting a RESTful API into the GOL world.
2. An AngularJS website consumes the core API to display a dashboard of interesting facts about the GOL world.
3. A mobile app built using Cordova and Ionic allows running GOL and viewing a few basic statistics.
